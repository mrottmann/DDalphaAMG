The DDalphaAMG solver library is an inverter for Wilson-Clover fermions from lattice QCD.

This is the branch sbacchio/master: it includes the twisted mass fermions and a personalized
  version of the library.

INSTALL:

  The main directory contains a makefile example. The standard makefile
  should work with a few adjustments (compiler and MPI library) on the 
  machine of your choice. Please note, that the code was built in a 
  generic manner. Thus, the actual code for compilation is created by 
  the makefile via pattern substitution right before the compilation.
  This part of the makefile should not be removed. Once the necessary 
  adjustments of the makefile are done, the command 
  "make -f yourmakefile -j numberofthreads wilson"
  should compile the whole entire Wilson solver code, such that it is
  ready to be run. The makefile contains additional rules "library" and
  "documentation" for compiling the code as a library and for compiling
  the user documentation. the library interface can be found in the
  "include" folder.

HOWTO:

  After having compiled the user documentation via
  "make documentation" please consult the compiled PDF in /doc for
  further information.
